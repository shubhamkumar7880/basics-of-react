This is a food delivery app made using react.js. We are using swiggy's live API, to get the data on our page. I have added many functionalities here, including a product listing page, a product detail page, filtering products, searching products, and adding products to the cart. Also, I have added test cases. For writing the test case, I have used the React testing library that includes jest.
